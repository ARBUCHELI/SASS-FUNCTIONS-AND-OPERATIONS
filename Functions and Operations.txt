# FUNCTIONS AND OPERATIONS

* Functions in SCSS
-------------------
Functions and operations in Sass allow for computing and iterating on styles.

With Sass functions you can:

	. Operate on color values

	. Iterate on lists and maps

	. Apply styles based on conditions

	. Assign values that result from math operations

This lesson will focus on unlocking their power!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Arithmetic and Color
----------------------
As mentioned, Sass specifically comes equipped with functions that make working with colors easier.

The alpha parameter in a color like RGBA or HSLA is a mask denoting opacity. It specifies how one color should be merged with another when the two are on top of each other.

	. In Sass, the function fade-out makes a color more transparent by taking a number between 0 and 1 and decreasing opacity, or the alpha channel, by that amount:

   $color: rgba(39, 39, 39, 0.5);
   $amount: 0.1;
   $color2: fade-out($color, $amount);//rgba(39, 39, 39, 0.4) 

	. The fade-in color function changes a color by increasing its opacity:

$color: rgba(55,7,56, 0.5);
$amount: 0.1;
$color2: fade-in($color, $amount); //rgba(55,7,56, 0.6)

	. The function adjust-hue($color, $degrees) changes the hue of a color by taking color and a number of degrees (usually between -360 degrees and 360 degrees), and rotate the color 
	wheel by that amount.

In main.scss, fade-out $lagoon-blue by 0.5:

$lagoon-blue: fade-out(#62fdca, 0.5);

Click “Run” to see your changes in the browser and inspect them in the output of main.css.

Do you see how the blue is now a ligher shade? It’s 50% more “transparent”.

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css">

<div class="math">Styled with Math!</div>

main.scss
---------
$width: 250px;
$lagoon-blue: fade-out(#62fdca, 0.5);

.math {
  width: $width;
  text-align: center;
  background-color: $lagoon-blue;
}

* Color Functions
-----------------
Sass also allows us to perform mathematical functions to compute measurements— including colors.

Here is how Sass computes colors:

	1. The operation is performed on the red, green, and blue components.

	2. It computes the answer by operating on every two digits.

$color: #010203 + #040506;

The above would compute piece-wise as follows:

01 + 04 = 05
02 + 05 = 07
03 + 06 = 09

and compile to:

color: #050709;

Sass arithmetic can also compute HSLA and string colors such as red and blue.

Try it. Add red and blue to make the font color of .math purple the following property:

color: red + blue;

.math {
  width: $width;
  text-align: center;
  background-color: $lagoon-blue;
  color: red + blue;
}
